# Workstation

My personal preferences on Linux systems. Adds packages and configurations
for a fine programming experience.

## Usage:

### RHEL Family

```
yum -y install ansible
cd stack/ansible
ansible-playbook site.yaml
exit  # Log back in
```

### Debian Family

```
apt-get -y install ansible
cd stack/ansible
ansible-playbook site.yaml
exit  # Log back in
```
